############ Frequency domain ##########
# Useful for signals with periodicities
# While time-domain analysis shows how a signal changes over time, frequency-domain analysis shows how the signal's energy is distributed
# over a range of frequencies. A frequency-domain representation also includes information on the phase shift that must be applied to each frequency component in order to recover the original time signal with a combination of all the individual frequency components.
# A signal can be converted between the time and frequency domains with a pair of mathematical operators called a transform.
# An example is the Fourier transform, which decomposes a function into the sum of a (potentially infinite) number of sine wave
# frequency components. The 'spectrum' of frequency components is the frequency domain representation of the signal.
# The inverse Fourier transform converts the frequency domain function back to a time function.
# The fft and ifft functions in MATLAB allow you to compute the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a signal and
# the inverse of this transform respectively.
# Spectral Entropy - Measure of the distribution of frequency components

# Also known as differential and acceleration coefficients. The MFCC feature vector describes only the power spectral
# envelope of a single frame, but it seems like speech would also have information in the dynamics i.e. what are the
# trajectories of the MFCC coefficients over time. It turns out that calculating the MFCC trajectories and appending
# them to the original feature vector increases ASR performance by quite a bit (if we have 12 MFCC coefficients,
# we would also get 12 delta coefficients, which would combine to give a feature vector of length 24).
